  abstract = {The Internet and related information technologies are transforming
	the distribution of product sales across products, and these effects
	are likely to grow in coming years. Both the Long Tail and the Superstar
	effect are manifestations of these changes, yet researchers lack
	consistent metrics or models for integrating and extending their
	insights and predictions. In this paper, we begin with a taxonomy
	of the technological and nontechnological drivers of both Long Tails
	and Superstars and then define and compare the key metrics for analyzing
	these phenomena. The core of the paper describes a large and promising
	set of questions forming a research agenda. Important opportunities
	exist for understanding future changes in sales concentration patterns;
	the impact on supply chains (including cross-channel competition,
	competition within the Internet channel, implications for the growth
	of firms, and the balance of power within the supply chain); implications
	for pricing, promotion, and product design; and, ultimately, the
	potential effects on society in general. Our approach provides an
	introduction to some of the relevant research findings and allows
	us to identify opportunities for cross-pollination of methods and
	insights from related research topics.},

	many items in the long tail have only a few ratings, thus making
	it hard to use them in recommender systems. The approach presented
	in this paper clusters items according to their popularities, so
	that the recommendations for tail items are based on the ratings
	in more intensively clustered groups and for the head items are based
	on the ratings of individual items or groups, clustered to a lesser
	extent. We apply this method to two real-life data sets and compare
	the results with those of the nongrouping and fully grouped methods
	in terms of recommendation accuracy and scalability. The results
	show that if such adaptive clustering is done properly, this method
	reduces the recommendation error rates for the tail items, while
	maintaining reasonable computational performance.},
