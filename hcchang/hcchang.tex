\section{Recently the paper I have read.}
To realize the research field of Lab, I choose the one of interesting papers published from Lab to read. \cite{huang2014building} Because I don't have any experience of Lab research, I still learn basic knowledge via Prof. Hsu AAI courses. On the other hand,  most of the papers I read are related to the computer vision because it is the major task of my job. \cite{tompson2012introduction, Zhang1999, Zhang2000, Li2014}
